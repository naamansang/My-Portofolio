        <p>Naaman Kipkirui Sang was born on 29th December 2002 in litein town,Kericho County, in Kenya.</p>
        <p>Just like many other village children,I grew up knowing that rice and chapati was only ment for Christmass
            days.<span>Ugali</span> and <span>Skuma Wiki was our daily meal which we cherished scince it was the only
                food we could acces</span> </p>
        <p>I spent most of my free time participating playing football and mostly running .</p>
        <p>Growing up, running for me was functional. Schoolchildren in Kenya often run long distances without thinking
            anything about it, I would run to school and back every day, also repeating the journey at lunch.I always
            had that someday i would become a well known atlethe just like Eluid Kipchoge , Ezekiel kemboi and many
            others.This was a dream which i kept in my mind not knowing that someday i would spent hours sitting on my
            computer rather than running in the hills of Nandi county as i always dreamt</p> <img src="images/at.jpeg"

        <p>But in 2011 at the age of 13 my changed forever when i was in school .That was when i first touched a
            Copmuter.Playing a computer game seemed stupid but little did i know that it would change a whole part of my
            career .I got intrested in Coputers from that momement.I promised myself that someday i make a game and also
            entice someone into the tech world as I was.
